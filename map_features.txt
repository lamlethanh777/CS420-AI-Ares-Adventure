1. Simple Case with One Stone and Target, Few Obstacles:

Objective: Test basic efficiency, step count, and node generation differences for each algorithm.
Expected Insight: BFS and DFS might generate excessive nodes, UCS and A* should be optimal.
Actual results: DFS and A* <<, while BFS and UCS >>
